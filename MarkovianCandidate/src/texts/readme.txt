/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain your overall approach.
 **********************************************************************/


 
/**********************************************************************
 *  Estimate using order-of-growth notation how much time and space
 *  your program requires to construct a Markov model from a data file
 *  of total size N characters, where k is the order parameter and
 *  S is the alphabet size. Regard k as a constant, and assume
 *  that symbol tables require logarithmic time per operation,
 *  and takes space proportional to the number of keys they contain.
 **********************************************************************/


/**********************************************************************
 *  Estimate using order-of-growth notation how much time and space
 *  your program requires to compute the log likelihood of a new test
 *  string of length n under such a model. Disregard the time and space
 *  used to construct the Markov model.
 **********************************************************************/


 
/**********************************************************************
 *  Train your program using the first two debates.  Then, using
 *  data from the third debate, create a table showing how often your
 *  program misclassified a Obama quote (i.e., incorrectly attributed
 *  the quote to McCain), and how often it misclassified a McCain quote,
 *  giving both as a function of the order parameter k.  Use a range
 *  of value for k, such as: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 50.
 **********************************************************************/



/**********************************************************************
 *  Write a brief paragraph exploring the effectiveness of this
 *  technique for this problem. You can do this however you wish, but
 *  try to be creative, thoughtful, perceptive, critical and objective.
 *  Your observations can be quantitative and systematic, or they can
 *  be more anecdotal.  You are welcome (but not required) to do more
 *  experiments besides the one in the last question. You might think 
 *  about questions like the following:  Which values of k seem to be
 *  most effective?  What about the behavior of this technique seemed
 *  to be what you would have expected, and what aspects seemed surprising?
 *  At an intuitive level, how does the method seem to be working
 *  (or not working)?  What features of the text seem to have the
 *  greatest influence on its effectiveness?  How does this approach to
 *  this problem compare to how a human might solve it?  What ideas do
 *  you have for improving it?

/**********************************************************************
 *  Known bugs / limitations.

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help (if any) that you received.
 *  Don't include readings, lectures, and precepts, but do
 *  include any help from people (including course staff, lab TAs,
 *  classmates, and friends) and attribute them by name.
