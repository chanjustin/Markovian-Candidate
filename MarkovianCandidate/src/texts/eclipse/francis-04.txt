Britain’s coalition government announced some time ago that there will be a new ‘emergency’ budget held on 22nd June this year. This budget will be the first since the Labour party’s last budget in office, in March. Since then there has been an election- which Labour lost miserably- and the new coalition Conservative- Liberal Democrat government has promised to begin spending cuts. This was something Labour said was bad for the economy, even though hundreds of important business leaders agreed with the Conservative policy. So it is a very good thing that finally Britain will maybe not take a big step, but will at least turn around- stop facing the abyss of recession, and look towards the fields of economic growth.
 
The cuts only amount to £6.2 billion, small considering Britain’s deficit this year is £156 billion, and the national debt £890 billion- or 62% of GDP. However small, though, this is the first step on an extremely important thing that Britain needs to do- prove to everybody that it can reduce it’s deficit. Without this first vital step, there will be little economic growth- only the miniscule growth like there has been over the six months or so, of 0.2 or 0.3%.
So George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will have a very tough job, trying to persuade everyone that the cuts are necessary, even though he will be telling the truth. But next year his job will be even harder- he will have more and bigger cuts, to completely eliminate the deficit. One day, perhaps, there will be a budget surplus, but don’t expect that too soon, and certainly not over the summer holidays when we from CIS will all be enjoying ourselves doing what we want!
