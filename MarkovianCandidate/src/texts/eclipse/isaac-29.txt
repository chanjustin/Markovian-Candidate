When it comes to influencing far-reaching policies such as those on the environment, it is difficult to give credence to arguments when actions speak differently. A notable case has been Al Gore’s infamous devouring of energy: his household energy consumption was twenty times that of an average American household just after “An Inconvenient Truth” was released in 2006. In the ongoing Copenhagen climate change conference, delegates traveled on 1200 limousines and 140 private planes, a far cry from what the billions of people they represent use daily, let alone have seen in their lifetimes. It is easy to make an emissions target or impose cap and trade whilst the taxpayer foots the bill and the working class pays for a higher cost of living.
Even in CIS, it won’t be a surprise when people use private cars when travelling to the “Walk for Change” campaign. Doesn’t that defeat the entire purpose of such an event? If the politicians and environmental campaigners really want ordinary citizens to help mitigate climate change, they can start with their own sacrifices instead, not shove the economic burdens onto the average Joe.
