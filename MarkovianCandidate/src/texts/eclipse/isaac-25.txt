Influential author J.D. Salinger died one week ago of natural causes in his New Hampshire home. Although reclusive, his seminal work, The Catcher in the Rye, has been popular for decades since its 1951 publication. Dealing with the themes of alienation and adolescence, it connects with teenagers across the world and across generations.
 The memorable protagonist, Holden Caulfield, leads an isolated adventure since his expulsion from a college preparatory school. Written in the first person perspective, the book captivates the reader in Holden’s intimate and often rambling thoughts. Although controversial for its profane and sexual content, it was awarded as one of the 20th Century’s top 100 novels by TIME magazine. Indeed, it is a must-read for all teenagers, and J.D. Salinger will be remembered as one of the great authors of recent times.
