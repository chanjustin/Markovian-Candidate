A couple of weeks ago, half of Year 9, those studying geography, spent two days in Tung Ping Chau, a small almost deserted island in the far North-East corner of Hong Kong, close to Guangdong province. While the other half looked at the history of Hong Kong, the geography students experienced two days of drivng winds and soaking rains, especially on Thursday.
Suppertime on that first day was characterised by the fact that everyone there had a varying degree of wetness, depending on the strength his or her raincoats had to resist the cloudburst outside. The more adventurous among the students, who were on the bow of the ferry on the way out, were suddenly driven back in a stampede to shelter from the hailstone-sized raindrops that had appeared as if out of nowhere.
â€¨The purpose of this trip? To learn more about the heritage of Hong Kong through learning about the many old houses on the island. We have two assessments on the topic. Now we are back at school and working on these, and we have all our data we collected on the island, and we think back to the Friday, when we studied the second of two villages in weather that was sunny and clear in complete contrast to the weather of that Thursday. We worked harder and in much better conditions than the day before. Now, when we think of Tung Ping Chau, we think of smiles and doing enjoyable work. We think back not to the time when we were soaked to the skin on Thursday evening but to the times on a sunny island on Friday, when we worked enthusiastically and enjoyed ourselves very much.
