The above phrase superimposes on a picture of the Tank Man in posters plastered on the school’s walls. This is thanks to CIS’s own Human Rights Group, which will be hosting a talk by political activist Han Dongfang on May 31st and a viewing of documentary The Gate of Heavenly Peace on June 1st. These events will be a solemn exploration of the Tiananmen Square protests which occurred 21 years ago. Even though we were unborn at 1989, our lives have been markedly changed by the event.
Many more in this school would probably be holding a Chinese or Hong Kong passport if not for the fear that the crackdown caused, which drove hundreds of thousands to emigrate to the likes of Canada, Australia, Singapore and the UK- countries which are seen prominently in the passports of the student body. Even more will have a more positive, or at least indifferent, view of China and its government.
Alas, the subsequent suppression of all mention of the protests serves as a marker of how little has changed politically, and does not help in making Hong Kong citizens more patriotic. All forms of media in China are forbidden to report on this event in an utterly Orwellian fashion to erase memories from the minds of a billion Chinese. The rise of the internet has been met with corresponding censorship, making it no easier to disseminate information. Hence this suppression of information just reminds us how incredibly lucky we are to be living on this Special Administrative Region, and not a few kilometers north in the mainland.
Our basic liberties, especially freedom of speech, are still intact and will hopefully still be for at least until 2047. With so much time until that year, important liberalizations can occur. But the current, glacial speed of an political reform in China is a reason to dampen any optimism.
