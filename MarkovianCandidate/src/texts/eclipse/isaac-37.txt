For a small group of eight Year 11 CT students, which included your correspondent, the first few weeks of school were mired with strange 'free periods' and 'lunch classes'. Apparently, our CT teacher was teaching a separate Year 10 class at the same time we had time slots allocated for CT. There were five of these overlapping slots, therefore allowing us five free periods. Three lunch classes were scheduled to compensate, whilst we were supposed to do CT work in two of the free periods. We were unprepared, surprised, and somewhat irritated, as we thought these issues would only occur in Year 12 and 13.
Admittedly it was not such a bad experience. Getting to have early lunch meant all the utensils were there, and the food was freshly cooked. With the large amount of assignments that the older years have to grapple, many lunches were devoted to work anyway. Free periods allowed us to decide on which tasks we would like to concentrate on in the quite peaceful environment of the library. Nonetheless, it was a good return to normalcy when the recent revision of our timetable allowed our CT teacher to teach us within appropriate periods as a separate teacher taught the Year 10s. But we will always remember the unique two weeks of free periods in our small Year 11 class.
