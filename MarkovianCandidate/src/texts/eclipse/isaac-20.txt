In his March 19th message, headmaster Dr. Faunce mused on watching 2C students diligently copying out Chinese characters. He then asked, “Do you remember this hunger for learning, Y11?” As a Year 11, I would realistically say that I do not remember my specific attitudes towards learning were nearly one decade ago. But whatever my reasons to learn were, they were probably a combination of curiosity and obedience, depending on the subject. Serious reflections on “why” or “how” I was learning would likely be less comprehensive than what we have to do in the Secondary.
The implicit message by asking such a question is that Year 11s could have forgotten the hunger to learn. As we should understand the importance of education and learning, this is a serious implication. However, it is difficult to gauge the hunger to learn. Even using the Personal Project (where students have to self-learn) is not a completely accurate method. This is because much of the time and resources devoted to the Personal Project are actually diverted to writing the reflective essays. Why so? Because the incentives provided is to write a good reflective essay. Hence, it is flawed to use the Personal Projects as a meter for the hunger to learning. The same can be said for all subjects and activities- Hard work, participation in after school activities and academic achievement does not necessarily entail a hunger to learn, or vice versa. Rather, I believe that it is out of school activities, or activities which would have been pursued without any compulsion, such reading an interesting book, that can accurately reflect a hunger for learning. If learning was done for genuine curiosity’s sake, not for grades or by the instruction, then a hunger for learning truly exists.
