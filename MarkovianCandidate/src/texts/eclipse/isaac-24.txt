The title comes from a fictional Sith mantra from the Star Wars universe, emphasizing the need of passion to keep one alive. However, the educational culture in China, Hong Kong, and many East Asian countries, contradicts self-ambition, as highlighted in Didi Kristen Tatlow’s article, Education as a Path to Conformity. * Indeed, the push for all-rounded excellence in our culture, exacerbated by admissions requirements of Ivy League universities, and an ever increasingly competitive and globalized society has sparked the craving for superchildren.
These to-be superchildren are enrolled from early age to play a musical instrument, master a sport, excel in the times tables and be fluent in at least two languages. During adolescence, the culture of perfectionism is so ingrained that students sign up for numerous commitments, from charities to debate teams, and cram for the SAT at the age of 16.
Sound familiar? Yes, you or your children probably have at least some of those characteristics, if not all. I’m guilty of it too. No wonder Hong Kong has a billion-dollar tutoring industry.
