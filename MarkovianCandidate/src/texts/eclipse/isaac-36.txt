Eight years after the horrific attacks on 9/11, American leaders still adopt a pre-9/11 mentality, not a post-9/11 mentality. Two Muslim countries have been invaded since then, which only exacerbated Islamic extremism by pushing the moderates who condemned the terrorist attacks to the extreme. Sure, there has been no repeat of a terrorist attack on US soil itself, but consequences of increased foreign intervention can be observed in Madrid and London. Countless other terrorist attacks have occurred, notably in Bali and Mumbai. Thousands of civilians and soldiers continue to die in a failing Afghanistan. Osama Bin Laden is nowhere in sight. Clearly the War on Terror has barely been won.
It is an extreme irony as well, that the people who suggest that 9/11 occurred because the terrorists “hate our freedoms”, are willing to sacrifice their own liberty through wiretapping, unwarranted arrests, torture, and indefinite detention. As Benjamin Franklin said, “They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” If such liberty is so easily traded off for security, and that thousands of American lives have been lost subsequent to the attacks, have the terrorists not achieved victory?
