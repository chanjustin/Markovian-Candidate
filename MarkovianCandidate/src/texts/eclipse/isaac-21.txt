There is an ongoing debate and a public vote over the choice of a school mascot, due to the concerns over the phoenix that Valerie Tang proposed in her personal project last year. The concerns revolve around the traditional Chinese form of the phoenix, or the Fenghuang. The phoenix is supposedly feminine, and that is one objection to its use. This is an unsound objection.
Firstly, the phoenix can both be male and female- “Fèng” representing the male phoenix, and “Huáng” representing the female. Hence, to say that the phoenix is purely feminine is wrong. Furthermore, even if the phoenix was ‘feminine’, what is wrong with that? This is a blatantly sexist reason to not use it. If the proposed mascot was ‘masculine’, like a dragon, I doubt there would have been the same uproar. We are a co-ed school, and there is nothing wrong with femininity in the school mascot to truly reflect our demographics.
