Monday was International Women’s Day, marked in school with a petition to improve the deplorable conditions of women in Burkina Faso. There, reproductive choices are curbed and healthcare has been largely neglected. Much of that could probably be attributed to sexist cultures as well as poverty. But it is here in Asia where the effects of sex discrimination have been egregiously large, despite modernization. Culture has not moved away from the outmoded ‘son preference’. Combined with modern technology such as the ultrasound, it is much easier to limit the amount of females being born. This can be seen by how the wealthier regions in China and India, and the developed countries of Singapore and Taiwan have more skewed sex ratios than poorer areas. Gender imbalance has been exacerbated by China’s one-child policy and declining fertility, causing many families to just have a male child and abort female fetuses.
Over a hundred million “missing girls” are the result of pervasive discrimination. They are artificially unborn or killed whilst young. The current generation of young and unborn males will also bear the burden of the previous generation’s sexist attitudes. 20-30 million men, translating to one-fifth of males, in India and China will have to stay single permanently, as there simply is a shortage in females.
