Pollution is becoming a major topic of discussion in Hong Kong, to say the least. How often do we hear people in the region talking about the subject? Every year, pollution is getting worse and worse. Last year, I remember when one couldn’t see Causeway Bay from CIS. A couple of weeks ago, when a family friend of ours on holiday from England had been up the peak and we asked what she thought about the view of Victoria Harbour, the response was “Harbour? What harbour?”
This has become a major issue in our lives, and some people are beginning to leave Hong Kong because of rising pollution levels. And why are pollution levels rising? Mostly because, people say, of factories over the border, and pollution coming South to Hong Kong. And why are these factories creating this pollution?
Looking over many cheap trinkets found in places all over Hong Kong, we find part of the answer. Some of these factories are producing these little objects that are not necessary, that are useless, and in many cases, which sit in a shop or a stall for a long time before being sold at half the original price. This little plastic figures are, in effect, aiding the pollution. They are useless and usually not wanted. Wouldn’t it be better to close the factories and give us a little fresh air?
