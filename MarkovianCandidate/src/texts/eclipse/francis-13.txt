A recent article by Isaac Lee describes how the railroad to Guangzhou is “a philosophy of violence and coercion”. It would seem that many people in Hong Kong agree with him. I don’t.
It was only over last weekend that a large group of protesters, numbering about 10,000, protested in Central against the high speed rail link that will begin to be built. On Saturday morning, I was in a tram going past the Legco building, and saw the long lines of florescent yellow coated policemen- hundreds of them- and even more protesters. There were drums, flags, and the night before, the protests had been violent. The protesters turned a couple of double decker buses around to block the road and attempted to attack Legco: 1,200 policemen forced them back with pepper spray. Some people in Hong Kong, it seems, think that this rail link is an extremely bad idea.
But Isaac Lee does not seem to understand the huge benefits that this railway would bring both to Hong Kong and to the rest of the Pearl River Delta. The railway will make a journey from West Kowloon to Guangzhou last 48 minutes. He has forgotten how much this railway will allow Hong Kong to develop better connections with the Pearl River Delta, something essential for the continued prosperity of Hong Kong. He has also forgotten how the railway may bring a reduction in road traffic, and consequently help to save the environment. Also, it may help unemployment, because more than 10,000 people will be needed to build the railway, and another 10,000 to run it.
Can Isaac Lee and all the protesters not see that this railway would heap huge benefits on Hong Kong and the region? If anyone has “a philosophy of violence and coercion” then it is the protesters.
