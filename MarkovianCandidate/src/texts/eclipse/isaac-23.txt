The film premiere on February 5th was testament to the prowess of our film classes and Ms. Wong, the film teacher. All years except year 9 had their best films presented. The genres were broad, ranging from sci-fi to films inspired by director Wong Kar Wai. A clear progression of technique can be observed, as the premiere started from the younger years, ending at the oldest. That is not to say the year 7 films were bad, in fact they were very good in their grasp of their unit on sci-fi, and used sophisticated equipment unseen a few years before.
The Year 11 films were the epitome of the premiere. With a focus on editing, the Film Noirs were enjoyable to watch, accompanied by crisp visuals and sound, augmented by superb acting. The Wong Kar Wai-inspired films were even better. With a localized Hong Kong setting, emotional backdrop and poignant tales, they connected with the audience and kept me riveted to the seat. Indeed, I stayed for the entire two and a half hour premiere, as the films got better and better. The quality and standard of films created a very high bar for future CIS filmmakers to reach. I hope that the next premiere at the end of this semester will be equally, if not better, in excellence.
