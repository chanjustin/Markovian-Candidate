The start of year heralds a new leadership of the Interact Club, a quasi-student-led charity organization, which aids all Year 11s to fulfill their 25 service hour requirement for MYP graduation. Unlike numerous other charities in the school, the president is democratically elected by the entire year group. The Interact committee, the core working group of the club, is chosen by different methods each year. This year, they were chosen democratically, save for the Webmaster position. In previous years, activities ranging from home cleanups to dress casual days were held. But every year has a distinct difference, and your correspondent had a chance to hear firsthand what has been planned for the charity group.
The presidentâ€™s goals are bold, with at least 25 hours of service, and 25 hours of community hours, enough to fulfill the MYP requirements starting from scratch, which would especially aid the newcomers to Year 11. For service hours, the president intended to look towards working with Caritas, a charity organization involved with helping the young and elderly. Unfortunately, fears over swine flu have brought such aspirations down. The secondary options of Oxfam and other Hong Kong based charities are being considered. Community hours are a harder challenge to tackle as community work usually revolves around school teams and services, relying on personal interest, skill, and dedication to complete. One idea for Interact to provide community hours is to have students take shifts in the CIS bookstore, which currently opens only three days a week. Whatever the eventual outcome, the democratic trust put on the Interact leadership will be tested.
