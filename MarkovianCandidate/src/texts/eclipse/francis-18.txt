Year 9, as some students may have noticed, were absent all of Thursday and Friday last week. We spent our time involved in a Science research trip to Hoi Ha Wan, in Sai Kung country park.
While we were there, we studied eco-systems including those on a beach, in mangroves, in an estuary and up a small river, observing little organisms that were about the place, or finding out in more detail how mangroves work. 
There were certainly some discomforts in the trip. Many people got rather wet when either deliberately swimming while trying to find some crab or fish, or when they fell off rocks and into the water, and not all of the food was thought by the picky students of Year 9 to be particularly good, however, most of the trip was enjoyable and informative as we found out more about Hong Kongâ€™s wildlife, and how diverse the ecosystems of the territory are. I believe that the vast majority of the students who were lucky enough to participate in it will long remember it as a very good trip.
