The team representing CIS won first place in the 5th Underwater Robot Challenge, hosted by City University. Composed of only three members, Benjamin Chasnov, Jonathan Chan, and Joe Hwong Pang, the team hurdled through a series of challenges, including not only practical underwater mission tasks, but also technical reports, engineering presentations and a poster display. Displaying excellence in all such fields, the CIS team grasped first place by a wide margin. The Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is the centerpiece of the competition. A range of disciplines, including design technology, computer programming, robotics, and a sophisticated understanding of electrical engineering is required to construct and use the ROV. The ROV has to be operated in a simulated situation of an underwater volcano seabed, where tasks such as placing sensors and collecting data were executed. Being remotely operated, team members rely on cameras and sensors mounted onto the ROV and are not allowed to view the underwater ROV.
This is the second year in which CIS has participated in the Underwater Robot Challenge. Last year, they landed 11th place. The 10-place hurdle represents true dedication and improvement. Many aspects of the ROV design have been upgraded from the previous attempt, such as propulsion and waterproofing. However, the hallmark trait of CISâ€™s ROV, which is the use of the joystick for control, remained unchanged. The process of the project has been a long one, with half the time dedicated to design and planning. There was even a pizza sale to raise funds to construct the ROV. With this landmark achievement, the CIS team is awarded HKD $10 000 and a chance to participate in the finals in Hawaii during June.
