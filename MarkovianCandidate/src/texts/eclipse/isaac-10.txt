Kick the Habit


Every school day should be a car-free day. The problem of private cars clogging up the roads of Hau Yuen Path affects every student and staff member. It is extremely unjust to have the private-car minority forcing everyone else to wake up early just so that their buses arrive before the traffic jam caused by the columns of luxury cars. For example, my bus, along with many others, arrives at school at 7.30am just to beat the traffic.


The situation is worse for those who walk to school- they have to inhale the collective and unnecessary emissions of hundreds of vehicles. If everyone took the bus or walked, we would all benefit by catching vital minutes of sleep whilst having cleaner air to breathe. It is ridiculous that not only are the private-transporters affecting Chinese International School, but also the numerous secondary schools that are located on Braemar Hill.


Unfortunately, years of Car Free Days have not resulted in a massive change in the entrenched private-car habits. The traffic and pollution are simply problems created by so many that the individual effort of a few people to change their own habits will be inconsequential. Therefore, it is vital to take this issue to both the lunch and dinner conversation, to make it a hot topic, rather than an issue solely trumpeted by the Green Team. Mass efforts should be made by everyone to convince the private transporters to kick the habit, helping them if there are alternatives. A consciousness-raising campaign, from the student grassroots level as from the leadership, will be needed to cleanse and unclog Hau Yuen Path.
