The last week has been a hectic one, a mixture of lying back with no work, wondering if there is any homework from Mr or Ms. So-and-so and if it is hidden on Moongate, which does not work, and if you should or should not email him/her, and then spending a double period doing several hours of work. It has been a week without balance of work or no work, with a faulty Moongate that, even when it did work, did so extraordinarily slowly, and one which I would certainly not wish to have again. One teacher said in our lesson this morning, ‘E-learning did not work, full stop.’ I completely agree with him. ‘I would rather had school as it was a lot less confusing, and Moongate failed horrifically,’ said a student. This seems to be the general feeling around the school.
I was surprised, therefore, when I asked another student on my bus whether he would rather have been at school, and he replied in the negative, saying that he had less work than normal. However, I do not agree with him. The last week was definitely not good, and I think the majority of the school will agree with me if I say that it would have been far better to be at school.
