Billion dollar blockbuster Avatar, the sci-fi version of Pocahontas, has clear underlying themes that can be directly associated with the current controversial project to build the Hong Kong-Guangzhou Express Railway. Like the blue-skinned Na’vi, villagers of Tsoi Yuen Tsuen face the destruction of their homes. Whereas the humans in Pandora sought the valuable “unobtainium”, the pro-railway supporters seek a possibly large economic advantage through a more efficient linking with mainland China. Indeed, the humans offered the Na’vi valuable compensation, like how the Tsoi Yuen Tsuen villagers were offered double the price of their land value.
Whilst the village does not face a dramatic battle with warships and incendiary rockets, the Railway project’s effect on them is the same as the human obliteration of the Na’vi home: the forcible removal of their property, backed by strong commercial interests. Whilst many decry the anti-Railway protesters’ storming of Legco as excessive, it is no less violent than the government expropriating and bulldozing villager’s houses. To paraphrase Milton Friedman, the $66.9billion railway project, “at its very bottom, is a philosophy of violence and coercion.”
