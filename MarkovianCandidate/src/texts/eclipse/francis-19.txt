Two weeks ago Year 9 went to Outward Bound. This physically challenging course has been completed by Year 9s from CIS for many years.
We spent our time either hiking up a number of mountains with large packs on our backs, kayaking until our arms were so tired they were beginning to fall off, or sailing with a group of twelve in a rather small ketch. My own group was hiking: we spent three days on the trail in East Sai Kung country park, in a mix of dense fog, incredible humidity, beating sun or a slow and miserable drizzle. By the end, our legs were tired, our shoulders were bruised, and we were recovering from experiences with a host of ants throughout the night. 
However, our experiences were not all bad. We learnt how to navigate, how to hike long distances, and how good or bad our stamina was. We learned about teamwork and about how easy it is to give up, but how one must not do so; we learned what it said on the badge that we were given at the end of the course, ‘TO SERVE TO STRIVE BUT NOT TO YIELD’. 
Our camp was, overall, enjoyable and exciting, despite certain bad things which hindered us on our way, certain mistakes, and certain times when we felt helpless, lost and very angry with ourselves. There were many bad things, but I would say that, in all, we gained more out of our week away than we lost from it.
