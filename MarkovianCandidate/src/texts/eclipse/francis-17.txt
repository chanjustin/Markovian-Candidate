A recent article by Isaac Lee on Moongate, ‘Reflection on Reflection’ debates what the point of writing reflections is. The answer is not as simple as he put it. The point is not only for the student to get a good mark in whatever Criterion it may happen to be about, not only ‘a piece of writing that effectively communicates the thoughts of the student’ but also a way for a student to understand what he or she is doing or did in that lesson so that they themselves know what to think about what they were doing, not just so teachers know what the students think but so students know what to think themselves. Many a time I personally have found myself understanding more about what I have been doing in a certain lesson after writing a reflection: my mind is clearer about the subject I am writing on. 
A reflection is certainly for the teacher as well. That is half the point, I think, of writing a reflection, but before that it is important that a student understands what they themselves did. It is no use, after all, writing something for a teacher about what you think about a lesson when you do not clearly know what you think. A reflection is not just for a teacher, but for the student as well.
