On the evening of the 5th of November, 1605, a group of plotters were caught attempting to assassinate King James I by blowing up the House of Lords. The person caught guarding the explosives was Guy Fawkes, and he was tortured to reveal the names of his fellow conspirators. He confessed, and the conspirators were sentenced to be hung, drawn and quartered. November the 5th is now celebrated in England for being “Guy Fawkes Day”: the day the Protestant King James I was miraculously saved. Bonfires, fireworks, and burning effigies of Guy Fawkes are highlights of this event.
 
Guys Fawkes and his colleagues did not have noble intentions. They wanted to revive Catholic domination of England by causing turmoil, sparking popular revolts against the repressive Protestant rule. It was an Animal Farm-esque situation, a reflection of how England swung between Catholic and Protestant rule. So it comes to no surprise that anti-Catholic legislation was ramped up after the plot’s failure.
 
Ironically, Guy Fawkes is now a symbol against oppression amongst Internet groups. Most notably, Guy Fawkes costumes are donned in anti-Scientology protests. This is most likely due to the glorification of the Guy Fawkes’ figure in the comic V for Vendetta and the subsequent film. Rather than being identified as a malevolent and failed assassin, Guy Fawkes has been transformed, somewhat like Che Guevera, into an icon of righteous rebellion.
