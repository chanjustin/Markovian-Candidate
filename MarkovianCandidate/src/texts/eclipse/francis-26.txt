Bake Sale on Wednesday
This Wednesday, 3rd June, the Philippines Book Project of Year 8 is holding a Bake Sale. We will be selling many delicious sweet foods, many of them home-made, and hope you can come at break or lunch to support us!
The Philippines Book Project aims to send the mass of books apparently sitting in the Multimedia Room off to a school in the Philippines- shipping costs a lot! The last time the books were sent, Mr. Topp (our Head of Year) showed us pictures of the children receiving the books, and the letters they wrote thanking us. It appears that the efforts of those involved were not wasted, and many Year 8s have joined this worthwhile charity.
