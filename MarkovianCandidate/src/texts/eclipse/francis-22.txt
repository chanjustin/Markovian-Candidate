Eight years ago (was it really that long ago?) the world was stunned by the collapse of the two towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. Casualty lists from all the attacks that day exceeded 3,000 dead and 6,000 wounded. I remember (as a young boy of five) watching the second plane crash into the tower on the television set in my living room in the small town of Halstead in England. It was a day that we will remember as being not only a terrible event but also one that happened in our life time.
What has happened since then? The invasion of Iraq has happened, Saddam Hussein executed, and now the country is slightly (although not that much) more peaceful than it was before 2003. Afganistan was invaded, and since 2001 the Taleban has been fighting back, resulting in higher and higher death lists on all sides. Then the Taleban invaded Northern Pakistan, and there has been unrest ever since then in that region. The ‘War on Terrorism’, as it has been coined, has resulted in the deaths of many people from many countries. How useful has it been, we ask ourselves?
