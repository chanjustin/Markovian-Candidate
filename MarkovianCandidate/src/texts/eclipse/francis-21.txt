In response to Isaac Leeâ€™s recent Article on the War of Terrorism, I agree to a certain extent. It is true that Iraq and Afganistan are both little or no better than they were eight years ago for the people living there, and that many people are being killed. However true this may be, I think that the War has certainly not resulted in an exceptionally large number of deaths compared to, for example, the number of people who die in road accidents. This is estimated by various sources at around 100 people per day. In contrast, not quite one thousand three hundred coalition soldiers have been killed in Afganistan since two thousand and one. That means that in eight years of fighting, two weeks of road casualties have been killed.
I am not saying that the war on Terrorism is a completely worthwhile event. It most certainly was not. I am only saying that it is not as terrible as some people think.
