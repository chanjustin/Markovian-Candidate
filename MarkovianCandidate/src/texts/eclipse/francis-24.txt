Last Thursday during Choices, Year 9 was herded into the Lower Gym for an assembly on what will be happening over the year. For some, the surprises were jumping of a bridge at six o¡¦clock each morning during project week. For others, it was our two-week trip to Yangshuo in Guangxi in May, and for some it was the incredible discovery of what the school uniform actually consists of.
We also learned something about our Year 9 charity. Crossroads is a very valuable charity that ships goods all around the world to places where people are in need. These goods are donated by people from around Hong Kong, and consist of many different goods from toys to sofas and x-ray machines. We are looking forward to supporting this valuable charity, and to (most of) the rest of our Year ahead.
