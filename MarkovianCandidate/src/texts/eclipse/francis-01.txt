In his latest article, Isaac Lee argued that the 28,000 American troops who are in South Korea have no purpose, that the South can stand up on its own against the North, and that Obama has more important things that he should be spending his money on, like America’s deficit. However, I beg to differ. While it is undoubtedly true that South Korea is prosperous and looks like being so for a long time yet, and its army is very well equipped and extremely large as well, the American troops are there for a different reason.
Not a military reason- with around 1.7 million men deployed around the border, 28,000 American troops would not, it is true, make terribly much difference in a battle. No, the real reason they are there is that North Korea is less likely to invade the South- or attempt to invade- if there are American troops actually on the ground. If they weren’t there, it is true that the USA would quite possibly go to war, but if its own troops were attacked there would be absolutely no reason not to. So they are there as a deterrent that even the spoilt child- or Kim Troll-il- might recognise.
North Korea has been a spoilt child and an annoyance to the world community for the past 60 years. To be honest, I would be surprised if there were to be a sudden bitter renewal of fighting between the two Koreas; rather I expect that this explosive hotspot, with South Korea being held back by America, and North Korea restrained by an ever more desperately embarrassed China, will be a thorn in the world’s side for a long time yet.
