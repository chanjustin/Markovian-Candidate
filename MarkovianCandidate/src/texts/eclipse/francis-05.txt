With the Euro having fallen to an eight year low against the Japanese Yen, and 2.8% against the US Dollar, and Greece in danger of defaulting even after having had 750 billion Euros pumped into it, and Spain about to enter into huge strikes by public sector workers facing a 5% pay cut, one could be excused for saying that the Eurozone is not doing very well- or possibly, when said by a less optimistic person, the Euro is heading for disaster.
If you cast your minds back to the last e:CLIPSe article on the Euro, on 10th May, Isaac Dunlap argued that bailing out Greece with 750 billion Euros will not save the problem, and Greece will still default. While he is right to a certain extent, I think that the real cause of today’s problems lie in two things- firstly the philosophy that living in debt is nothing to be worried about, and it doesn’t matter, the philosophy that has been Europe’s, but most importantly in the actually creation of the Euro.
The Euro ha always been an aim of the European Union. They always wanted to get everyone inside the union to use a single currency that would become good and stable. It took a very long time for the idea to become a reality: from 1969, when people really thought it up, to 1999, when it came into existence. Even then, not all the countries in the EU adopted the new currency. The problem was that creating a successful new currency isn’t easy, and, as time seems to be telling, it was never going to be successful. People didn’t need it; it’s only purpose was the union of countries into one currency.
So overall, the terrible state of the Euro is not wholly to blame on the bail-out package, on Greece or on the debt philosophy. A big part of the problem was the currency itself. It never needed to exist and it shouldn’t exist. Maybe China should solve Europe’s problems by buying the continent?
