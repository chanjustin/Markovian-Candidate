The second issue of the student-run XiaoHua magazine was distributed, free of charge, to all of the CIS community on June 1st. It follows the high standard set by its inaugural issue earlier this year. The magazine is virtually indistinguishable from many other professionally produced prints, from its well designed glossy pages to the occasional advertisements that support its large printing costs. It is even a step further in sophistication by featuring bilingual articles.
At more than 100 pages, this is a monumental project for secondary school students. XiaoHua’s founder and Editor-in-Chief, Jonathan Lu, heads a large, multi-layered body of writers, artists, and fundraisers. The magazine’s many well written articles include fashion news, alumni interviews, and an article on baby boomers as diverse as the writers who compose the writing department. The art featured is also wide-ranging, from line sketches to a computer generated concept of a futuristic classroom. The business side of the organization secures necessary deals in a mature fashion, demonstrated by the assorted advertisements from companies and tuition centers.
However, there should be a more rigorous approach to originality. For example, some images had their source cited, but not for others. There are instances where a person has ‘lent’ their name to be used, although the actual information presented did not directly originate from that person. The quotations regarding sports uniforms on page 102 are an example of this. One feature article, entitled “Reflections on Reflections” presented arguments that were not fresh or different from what has been contended here on e:CLIPSE. Indeed, enhanced authenticity of content will be a great step forward for XiaoHua, making it an even more enriching student publication.
