Today, in Copenhagen, Denmark, 15,000 people will gather to attend the UN world summit on climate change. Over the next two weeks, more than 100 world leaders are due to go to the conference, including the US President Obama, the Prime Minister of the UK, Gordon Brown, the French President, Sarkozy, and the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
 They are meeting to discuss targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to try to come to agreements on climate change, and to try to make sure that destruction of forests will end by 2030.  However, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding the conference. Will anything happen? Will it be simply a waste of time? Will no-one solve anything? People wonder whether there will be nothing but a load of promises that will not be kept? There will be no treaty after the conference, so will anything come of it? Some people believe that it could affect our world, make it a better place and get rid of pollution, but more people seem to believe that it is a big show but nothing will happen. Which one will it be? This is an interesting question, and one that time only can answer.
