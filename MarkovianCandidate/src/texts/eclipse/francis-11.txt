Before Isaac Dunlap argues about this topic, I would advise that him to go out and have a look at what is going on. Why doesn’t he take a trip down to somewhere like Stanley market, where there are many goods in stalls, useless trinkets that have not been sold and are therefore sold at half price? Why doesn’t he take a look at what the Chinese factories are producing, goods that end up discounted and sold cheaply, goods that really didn’t need to be made at all? In fact, they hardly deserve the name ‘goods’ at all; they are more like ‘bads’ or ‘uselesses’.
What is more, perhaps if closing down the factories is not an option, they could produce something slightly more useful? Do not say that the PRC government controls nothing in China- they do. While China may not be wholly communist, they are certainly not fully capitalist either. There are certainly lots of useful things Chinese factories could produce- so why don’t they produce these things? People in charge of factories don’t realise that there are far better things they could make- included among them could be machinery aiding research into how to get rid of pollution, or to pollute less in the first place. Isaac may be very good at economics, but perhaps he does not realise that some factory owners are not up to his standards in the subject.
Certainly these cheap trinkets aren’t the only reason for our pollution, and I agree with him on ideas to regulate the pollution of factories and vehicles, but they are, at least, the most pointless way that our skies are polluted
