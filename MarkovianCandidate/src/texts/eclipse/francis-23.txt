On Friday, the Secondary school divided into Year groups and began the first Enrichment time Session. This was the first of a long-planned series of activities that have been planned for years to enliven CIS.
The Year 8s and Year 9s were herded into the Upper Gym, where we proceeded to listen to a guest speaker for an hour and twenty minutes. The topic was the problems facing Hong Kong Marine Wildlife, and the speaker from the Hong Kong University.
There was a variety of opinions as to whether or not this was an interesting period of time. Many people appeared to have enjoyed the talk, and have found it very interesting. Others yawned and stretched the minute they were allowed to get up, and explained how boring the session had been to them, and how they had whiled away their time. However, there is no doubt that those who actually listened gained a certain amount of information on how fish-balls are often actually shark meat (after this point was told a gasp arose from the crowd of students), or how much shark meat goes to waste, or the number of sharks killed per year (73 million).
The first of these sessions passed with mixed feelings. I wonder what people will say of the next one?
