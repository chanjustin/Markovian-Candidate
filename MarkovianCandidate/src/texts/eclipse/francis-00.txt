Egypt’s dictatorial old totalitarian government has been overthrown, after the same happened in Tunisia. Congratulations to the Egyptians! They have proved that the will of the majority of people will always prevail, even if it is a long time coming, and now Egypt (and Tunisia) are becoming only the first of a long list of countries across North Africa and the Arab world with huge protests and possibilities of more revolutions- Morocco, Bahrain, Algeria, Yemen, and (largest of all) Libya.
The only cause for concern with the current Egyptian system is the fact that when President Mubarak resigned he handed power over to the military leaders- Egypt is still not a democracy. The military said that they would rule for six months or until they were able to sort out new and totally democratic elections. Now it may just be a defect in the world news reporting system, with the BBC and other news providers fixing on more pressing or incredible news (like, for example, the happenings in Libya) that we have not heard any dates or promises of dates or apologies for the lack of them since the day after Mubarak resigned, or alternatively it might- just possibly- signify that the elections will not be coming as soon as all the protesters hoped.
It was wonderful that the Egyptians forced Mubarak from power, but now they must calm down in their jubilations and try to focus on pressing the current government to follow up on their promises. If the elections do not come, it could send a message to other protesting nations that even once they come within a hair’s breadth of success, failure and dictators could return from what would seem to be the edge of an abyss. As British Prime Minister David Cameron, the first foreign leader to visit the country since the revolution, said when he was there, ‘This is a great opportunity for us to go and talk to those currently running Egypt to make sure this really is a genuine transition from military rule to civilian rule.’So I hope that the military leadership of Egypt does what they know is right by hurrying up and calling the elections.
