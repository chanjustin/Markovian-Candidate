Whilst most of the Year 11s’ Personal Projects are drawing to a close, students who entered the year in September 2009 have a few months in extension to help them catch up. Amongst them is Brian Liu, who will be hosting a charitable event, the “Fun Run”, for the Liveate Cambodian Village School.
Brian lived in Cambodia for a few years as his father was offered a job in a free Phnom Penh hospital. There, he “fell in love with the country and its people.” Once back in Hong Kong, decided to focus his personal project on alleviating the suffering in the poverty-stricken country. However, he realizes that not many people are interested in such an event, evident by the lack of confirmed attendees to the “Fun Run”. Fortunately for Brian, the Personal Project does not grade the product, and therefore it matters little, in academic terms, whether one person participates, or one thousand, whether one dollar is raised, or ten thousand. Rather, it is the goal-setting, the process, and the reflection that is paramount in the Personal Project. Alas, less money will be sent to the Cambodian children with the lack of attendees.
