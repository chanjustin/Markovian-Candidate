It has been a surprise to many that Barack Obama, after being President for less than nine months, has received one of the most prestigious prizes ever awarded, the Nobel Prize for Peace. This shock, and sometimes even outrage, is completely justifiable. The first question someone would ask is, “What peace?” Indeed, Obama is presiding over two, prolonged and bloody wars. In fact, Obama has desired to escalate the conflict in Afghanistan by sending tens of thousands of more troops. Not only that, Obama has condoned and approved drone attacks in Pakistan that have killed dozens of innocent civilians. The “War on drugs” has no sign of relenting, which even The Economist dubs as “illiberal, murderous and pointless”, as neighboring Mexico is bearing the brunt of through gang wars. Little progress has been made in regards to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, with the United States continuing to send billions in military aid to Israel, supplying it the capability to wage conflicts which the UN has condemned as disproportionate. Perhaps what is the most ironic of all is the recent refusal to meet with a former Nobel Laureate, the Dalai Lama, a man regarded as one of the most peaceful in the world. It seems that according to the Nobel committee, that War is Peace.
