From 7th to 18th December 2009, world leaders met at the UN Climate Change summit at Copenhagen. It was absolutely remarkable what they managed to achieve- absolutely nothing. For two weeks they succeeded in doing nothing on a pressing issue. There was no resolution at the end of it: no-one did a thing about it. It happened, and then it stopped. That was it. End of story.
In fact, it did more harm than good for everything apart from the German Limousine building industry, because so many limousines were needed to transport world leaders from Copenhagen airport to the summit. It is estimated that the world leaders between them used 200 private jets to get there, and 4000 limousines were needed. Is this how world leaders are trying to make us change our habits? Do they think that the way to solve climate change is to waste fuel and add to carbon emissions? So it seems. 
Perhaps that is because of where the summit was held. Copenhagen is not exactly renowned as a place greatly effected by climate change. Perhaps if the summit had been held in the world’s most polluted city, Linfen, in Shangxi province, China, some of the world leaders might have learned what pollution means. We in Hong Kong also know something of pollution.
So what was the point? Copenhagen was meant to be a place of change, when the world would agree to cut carbon emissions. Instead, it has been worse than nothing. What is more politicians are starting to blame each other: the British Climate Change Secretary, Ed Miliband, accused China of ‘sinking an agreement’; in return the Chinese said that British politicians were ‘engaging in a political scene’. Can these people not see that, however despicable China’s action at the summit (and they were not at all very good) they are bickering on about very little: the simple fact is that Copenhagen was a waste of time and energy, and was more useless than nothing.
